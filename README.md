# Dice

## Objective

Who doesn't love a good game of dice?

Create a `roll` function that returns 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 randomly!

Search for how to generate random numbers in javascript. Write your roll function in lib/dice.js.

Open index.html in the browser to test your function at work!

## Challenge
Add another function to roll two dice at the same time!

How would you have both available in index.html?
